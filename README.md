# CatGenerator
quick app to generate random cat images


A fun and simple app that brings up a new cat with every click! Courtesy of https://thecatapi.com/

Script
This app uses jQuery to make AJAX requests to https://thecatapi.com/

The DOM contains a simple submission form which accepts only a button. The button initiates a request, and retrieves the random cat image to be rendered. This image then populates an emptied 'div' tag.
